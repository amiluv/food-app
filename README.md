## MY REASON FOR WORKING ON THIS FOOD DELIVERY APP PROJECT

I have mostly visited food restaurants and eateries, especially in Lagos Nigeria, and noticed how people flock in to buy food, 
most of whom buy and take away rather than eat in the restaurant. Again, the customers are often much, coming in their numbers but the attendants are always few, 
causing these long waiting times, queues, and overall service dissatisfaction. So, developing a food delivery app will reduce these misdemeanors. 
Customers donâ€™t have to leave their homes, shops, engagements, etc. to come queue up, and wait to be served. 
They could place orders for their desired dish from the comfort of their homes, offices, shops, etc., and in 5 to 10 minutes, 
the food is at their doorstep depending on the customer's proximity to the restaurant. 
Furthermore, I intend to make the app more encompassing such that, customers will be able to choose from a list of restaurants closer to them 
and order any kind of food as provided/available in such restaurants.
The overall objective of this project is to ease stress (long queue and waiting time, transportation risk and cost, getting alternate things done in less time and without stress, etc.).
I used the Laravel framework for this project and for documentation purpose, lets learn a little about laravel

## ABOUT LARAVEL
Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. I believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
