MY REASON FOR WORKING ON THIS FOOD DELIVERY APP PROJECT
I have mostly visited food restaurants and eateries especially in Lagos Nigeria, and noticed how people flock in to buy food, 
most of who buy and take away rather than eating in the restaurant. Again, the customers are often much, coming in their numbers but the attendants are always few, 
causing these long waiting time, queues and overall service dissatisfaction. So, I thought developing a food delivery app will reduce these misdemeanors. 
Customers donâ€™t have to leave their homes, shops, engagements, etc. to come queue up, waiting to be served. 
They could place orders for their desired dish at the comfort of their homes, offices, shops, etc. and in 5 to 10 minutes, 
the food is at their door step depending on the customers proximity to the restaurant. 
Further-more, I intend to make the app more encompassing such that, customers will be able to choose from a list of restaurants closer to them 
and order for any kind of food as provided/available in such restaurants.
The overall objective of this project is to ease stress (long queue and waiting time, transportation risk and cost, getting alternate things done in lesser time and without stress, etc.).
